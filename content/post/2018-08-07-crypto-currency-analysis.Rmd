I came across the following package __coinmarketcapr__ that would bring back current prices of the bitcoin verity. In the following you can find just a couple simple examples to be able to observe the current prices.  


## Code 
```{r warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(coinmarketcapr)
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
```



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#get the global market cap details and assign it to a dataframe
all_coins <- get_marketcap_ticker_all()
DT::datatable(all_coins)
```


## Simple Visualization 

```{r}
all_coins %>%  top_n(10, price_usd) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(symbol, -as.numeric(price_usd)), y = as.numeric(price_usd))) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = 'Crypto-Currency', y = 'USD ($)', title = 'Top 10 Cryptocurrencies and their Value in USD')
```
