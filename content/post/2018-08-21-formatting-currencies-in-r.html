<p>here are a few different ways to format numbers in R. A few of theme can be accomplished using the <em>paste</em> function in R. Iâ€™ve found that there are a few different methods to do this.</p>
<div id="using-the-scales-package" class="section level3">
<h3>Using the scales package</h3>
<p>Using the <em>scales</em> packages from Hadley, there is a great function with various options including passing a vector.</p>
<pre><code>    library(scales)
    dollar_format()(c(-100, 0.23, 1.456565, 2e3))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="formatting-currency-with-separator" class="section level3">
<h3>Formatting currency with separator</h3>
<p>Following is a simple function one can build and place in their utility function that will give formatted currency.</p>
<pre><code>myNum = 1234.12 

toCurrency &lt;- function(money)
{
    paste(&quot;$&quot;,format(money, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;),sep=&quot;&quot;)
}

toCurrency(myNum)</code></pre>
</div>
