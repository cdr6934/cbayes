Attached are a few different things that I have played with over the past couple years. I enjoy the beauty of what generative design can do and how nature can be imitated to produce chaotic systems that represent a moment of beauty. So this is always going to be a work in process as I add additional content to the page. I hope that it is helpful and inspiring.
