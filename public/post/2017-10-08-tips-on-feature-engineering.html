<h2>Tips on Feature Engineering</h2>
<ul>
<li>to fit how classifiers work; giving a geometry problem to a tree, oversized dimension to a kNN and interval data to an SVM are not a good ideas</li>
<li>remove as much nonlinearities as possible; expecting that some classifier will do Fourier analysis inside is rather naive (even if, it will waste a lot of complexity there)</li>
<li>make features generic to all objects so that some sampling in the chain won’t knock them out</li>
<li>check previous works – often transformation used for visualisation or testing similar types of data is already tuned to uncover interesting aspects</li>
<li>avoid unstable, optimizing transformations like PCA which may lead to overfitting</li>
<li>experiment a lot</li>
</ul>
