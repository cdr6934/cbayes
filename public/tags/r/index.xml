      <description>The following function can be used to find and display the internal IP address needed to retrieve the IP address from Hue Bridge. You will need to generate an API key i.e. a “userkey” as I called it below.
getIP &amp;lt;- function() { url &amp;lt;- paste0(&amp;quot;https://www.meethue.com/api/nupnp&amp;quot;) res &amp;lt;- httpGET(url) resJson &amp;lt;- fromJSON(res) res &amp;lt;- resJson[[&amp;quot;internalipaddress&amp;quot;]] res }  In order to know what light you should change the state on, one can run the following to retrieve the available lights connected on the network.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, seeing data in a 3 dimensional space gives us better visibility to the rest of the world. You will see that we have taken a hypothetical experiment and tried to rate different ideas by their complexity and likelihood to succeed.

Approximate Bayesian Computation
 Generate a trial value for the thing we want to know (in this case its the conversion fraction of a layout) Simulate or data assuming the trail value, keep the trial value, otherwise discard it and try again If the simulation looks like the real data, keep the trial value, otherwise discard and try again Keep doing this until we’ve got lots of trial values that worked  library(progress) library(ggplot2) library(reshape2) # Variables n_visitors_a &amp;lt;- 100 # number of visitors shown layout A n_conv_a &amp;lt;- 4 # number of vistors shown layout A who converted (4%) n_visitors_b &amp;lt;- 40 n_conv_b &amp;lt;- 2 Using Bayesian Systems</description>

      <title>Tips on Creating Effective and Functional Documentation in R</title>
      <link>/2017/09/22/tips-creating-functional-documention/</link>

      <description>Just like any skill, there is a learning curve involved in creating effective communication. This involves the code written and the documentation of its usage. Writing functional code is a intricate thing to accomplish as a newbie. It takes time to know what is efficient and how to communicate it as such. Now, writing functional documentation is more complicated as there is a delicate balance between not reguritate what the code says, and giving usable pointers to the users on how a particular function was intended to be used.</description>

      <description>In the ever changing world of retail; one always has to keep one step ahead of the competition and to engage with its customers. One of the best ways
 Formulate a test Implement Test Evaluate results Adjust the test Try again.  These are all great ideas, but how do we truly watch tas things get better?
