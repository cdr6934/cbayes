      <description>Here are a few different ways to format numbers in R. A few of theme can be accomplished using the paste function in R. I’ve found that there are a few different methods to do this.
Using the scales package Using the scales packages from Hadley, there is a great function with various options including passing a vector.
 Formatting currency with separator Following is a simple function one can build and place in their utility function that will give formatted currency.</description>

      <description>The following function can be used to find and display the internal IP address needed to retrieve the IP address from Hue Bridge. You will need to generate an API key i.e. a “userkey” as I called it below.
getIP &amp;lt;- function() { url &amp;lt;- paste0(&amp;quot;https://www.meethue.com/api/nupnp&amp;quot;) res &amp;lt;- httpGET(url) resJson &amp;lt;- fromJSON(res) res &amp;lt;- resJson[[&amp;quot;internalipaddress&amp;quot;]] res }  In order to know what light you should change the state on, one can run the following to retrieve the available lights connected on the network.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, seeing data in a 3 dimensional space gives us better visibility to the rest of the world. You will see that we have taken a hypothetical experiment and tried to rate different ideas by their complexity and likelihood to succeed.

      <description>Just like any skill, there is a learning curve involved in creating effective communication. This involves the code written and the documentation of its usage. Writing functional code is a intricate thing to accomplish as a newbie. It takes time to know what is efficient and how to communicate it as such. Now, writing functional documentation is more complicated as there is a delicate balance between not reguritate what the code says, and giving usable pointers to the users on how a particular function was intended to be used.</description>
