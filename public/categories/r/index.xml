      <description>Threw error due to the API In the past, the best way to get stock prices was to use either Google Finance or Yahoo Finance data streams. These have since become difficult to keep up to date and thus another outlet to get this information is AlphaVantager. Following is a simple R implementation to get up to date data. You will be able to thus use this to find the information.</description>

      <description>Tips on Feature Engineering  to fit how classifiers work; giving a geometry problem to a tree, oversized dimension to a kNN and interval data to an SVM are not a good ideas remove as much nonlinearities as possible; expecting that some classifier will do Fourier analysis inside is rather naive (even if, it will waste a lot of complexity there) make features generic to all objects so that some sampling in the chain won’t knock them out check previous works – often transformation used for visualisation or testing similar types of data is already tuned to uncover interesting aspects avoid unstable, optimizing transformations like PCA which may lead to overfitting experiment a lot   </description>

      <description>Just like any skill, there is a learning curve involved in creating effective communication. This involves the code written and the documentation of its usage. Writing functional code is a intricate thing to accomplish as a newbie. It takes time to know what is efficient and how to communicate it as such. Now, writing functional documentation is more complicated as there is a delicate balance between not reguritate what the code says, and giving usable pointers to the users on how a particular function was intended to be used.</description>

      <description>The longer I’ve worked in software development, the more I have to stress the importance of developing a methodology of naming, version control, and organizing all the various scripts that have been written.
Following are a couple tips of advice I’ve collected over the last five years. I’ve found them to be crucial to implement and habitualize best practices that are similar to these. It will save you time and also will make you more efficient.</description>

      <description>Sign up to R-Studio’s free 45 day trial so that you have the install. This will give you the ability to install right straight from their site. I went to Digital Ocean for this use case. Generally you will want to add this either to a local server on your network, or you can add it to a cloud provider. This can be whatever you are most comfortable.

      <description>here are a few different ways to format numbers in R. A few of theme can be accomplished using the paste function in R. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that there are a few different methods to do this.
Using the scales package Using the scales packages from Hadley, there is a great function with various options including passing a vector.
	library(scales) dollar_format()(c(-100, 0.23, 1.456565, 2e3))  Formatting currency with separator Following is a simple function one can build and place in their utility function that will give formatted currency.</description>

      <description>The following function can be used to find and display the internal IP address needed to retrieve the IP address from Hue Bridge. You will need to generate an API key i.e. a &amp;ldquo;userkey&amp;rdquo; as I called it below.
getIP &amp;lt;- function() { url &amp;lt;- paste0(&amp;quot;https://www.meethue.com/api/nupnp&amp;quot;) res &amp;lt;- httpGET(url) resJson &amp;lt;- fromJSON(res) res &amp;lt;- resJson[[&amp;quot;internalipaddress&amp;quot;]] res }  In order to know what light you should change the state on, one can run the following to retrieve the available lights connected on the network.</description>
